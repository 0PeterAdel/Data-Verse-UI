# Data-Verse Documentation

## Architecture Overview
Data-Verse is a data processing and visualization platform designed for scalability and performance. The application consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, featuring dynamic routing and lazy-loaded components.
- **Backend**: An Express.js server handling API requests, file uploads, and data processing.
- **Database**: In-memory storage for job results (can be extended to use a database like MongoDB).
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI integrated for detailed API documentation.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Upload File
**POST** `/api/upload`
- **Description**: Uploads a file to the server.
- **Request Body**: Multipart form-data with a `file` field.
- **Responses**:
  - `200 OK`: File uploaded successfully.
  - `400 Bad Request`: No file uploaded.

### 2. Preview File
**GET** `/api/preview`
- **Description**: Provides a preview of the uploaded file.
- **Responses**:
  - `200 OK`: Returns a preview of the file.
  - `404 Not Found`: No file found.

### 3. Process File
**POST** `/api/process`
- **Description**: Initiates processing of the uploaded file.
- **Security**: Requires a Bearer token.
- **Responses**:
  - `200 OK`: Processing started.
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid token.

### 4. Get Results
**GET** `/api/results/{jobId}`
- **Description**: Retrieves the results of a processing job.
- **Security**: Requires a Bearer token.
- **Responses**:
  - `200 OK`: Returns job results.
  - `404 Not Found`: Job not found.

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Production Deployment on Kali Linux
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install PM2 globally: `npm install -g pm2`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`.
4. Start the application using PM2:
   ```bash
   pm2 start pm2.config.json --env production
   ```
5. Monitor the application: `pm2 monit`

## CI/CD Setup
### GitHub Actions Workflow
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This workflow automates the following tasks:
- Linting the codebase.
- Running unit and integration tests.
- Building the project.
- Optionally deploying the application.

To trigger the workflow, push changes to the `main` branch or open a pull request targeting `main`.

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are configured in GitHub Secrets:
- `SENTRY_DSN`: The Sentry Data Source Name for error monitoring.
- `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for JWT authentication.

## Monitoring Setup
### Sentry Integration
Sentry is used for error monitoring. To configure Sentry:
1. Add your Sentry DSN to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
   ```
2. Errors are automatically captured and reported to Sentry.

### Winston Logging
Winston is configured to log errors to both the console and a file (`error.log`). Logs can be found in the root directory.

## Backup and Performance Scripts
### Backup Script
The `backup.sh` script automates backups of key directories and files. To use it:
1. Run the script manually:
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh
   ```
2. Schedule it using `cron` for automated backups:
   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
   ```

### Performance Benchmarking
The `benchmark.js` script measures API response times. To run it:
```bash
node benchmark.js
```

## Future Extensions and Scalability
### Roadmap
- **Advanced AI Modules**: Integrate machine learning models for data analysis.
- **Third-Party API Integration**: Add support for external data sources.
- **User Analytics**: Implement analytics dashboards for user behavior insights.

### Scalability Enhancements
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for consistent deployments.
- **Orchestration**: Leverage Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Break down the monolith into smaller, independent services.

### Automated Scaling
- Use cloud services like AWS or GCP for auto-scaling.
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently.

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Modules
1. Create a new route or component in the appropriate directory.
2. Update the API documentation in `server.js` with Swagger comments.
3. Test the new module using Jest and Supertest.

### Adding New Features
1. Identify the feature's scope and update the architecture diagram.
2. Follow the existing code style and structure.
3. Document the feature in `DOCS.md` and `README.md`.
