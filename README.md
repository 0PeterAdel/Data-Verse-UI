# Data-Verse

## Project Overview
Data-Verse is a data processing and visualization platform designed to handle large datasets efficiently. It provides tools for uploading, previewing, processing, and visualizing data, making it ideal for data analysts and researchers.

### Core Functionalities
- File upload and preview.
- Data processing pipelines.
- Interactive data visualization.
- Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication.
- Scalable architecture with clustering support.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- Kali Linux (or any Linux distribution)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Data-Verse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment Instructions

### Steps for Kali Linux
1. Install PM2 globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```
2. Start the application in production mode:
   ```bash
   pm2 start pm2.config.json --env production
   ```
3. Monitor the application:
   ```bash
   pm2 monit
   ```

## Testing & CI/CD

### Running Tests
- Unit and integration tests are written using Jest and Supertest.
- Run tests with the following command:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### CI/CD Integration
- Use GitHub Actions or any CI/CD tool to automate testing and deployment.
- Ensure the `.env` file is configured correctly in the deployment environment.

## CI/CD Setup
The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and automates linting, testing, building, and deploying the application.

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following secrets are added to GitHub:
- `SENTRY_DSN`: For Sentry error monitoring.
- `JWT_SECRET`: For JWT authentication.

## Monitoring and Logging
### Sentry
Sentry is integrated for error monitoring. Add your Sentry DSN to the `.env` file:
```env
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
```
### Winston
Winston is used for logging errors to both the console and a file (`error.log`).

## Backup and Performance Scripts
### Backup Script
The `backup.sh` script automates backups of key files and directories. Run it manually or schedule it with `cron`.

### Performance Benchmarking
The `benchmark.js` script measures API response times. Run it using:
```bash
node benchmark.js
```

## Scalability Roadmap
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for deployments.
- **Orchestration**: Manage containers with Kubernetes.
- **Microservices**: Transition to a microservices architecture for better scalability.
